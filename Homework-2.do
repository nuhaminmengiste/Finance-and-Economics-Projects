* 2a 
gen per_capita = gasexp/(gasp*pop)
regress per_capita income gasp pnc puc ppt pd pn ps year
vif

*2b, testing the hypothesis that the changes in the prices of used and new cars do not affect peopleâ€™s decisions to purchase gas.
regress per_capita income gasp pnc puc ppt pd pn ps year
test pnc == puc

*2c
* price elasticity of demand without using log apparently , just using the margins, eyex
* price elasticity of demand
regress per_capita gasp 
margins if year == 2004,  eyex (gasp)

* price elasticity of income 
regress per_capita income
margins if year == 2004, eyex (income)

* cross price elasticity with the cross-price elasticity with respect to changes in the price of public transportation (aka the gasp with the ppt)
regress gasp ppt 
margins if year == 2004, eyex (ppt)

* 2d elasticity of the entire regression using log

* additional work 
* price elasticity of demand using logarithms

* cross price elasticity of ...
gen log_ppt = log(ppt)
regress log_gasp log_ppt


* 2e, simple correlation of the price variables to check for multicollinearity 
pwcorr( gasp pnc puc ppt pd pn ps)

*2f, changed all the price index value of 2004 to 100 (aka renormalized the price indexes to that year), and then rerun the regressions a and d
